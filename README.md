# ü§î Learning from Pattern Completion: Self-supervised Controllable Generation

Inspired by the cortical modularization and hippocampal pattern completion, we propose a self-supervised controllable generation (**SCG**) framework to achieve pattern completion and generate images.

## News

- üçæ Sep, 2024: [**SCG**](https://qizekun.github.io/shapellm/) is accepted by NeurIPS 2024, congratulations! We will release offical version as soon, please check in homepage.
- üéâ Apr, 2024: For those interested, we update a [pre-release code](https://gitee.com/chenzq/control-net-main) in Gitee.


## üìÑ Intro

Our model is built upon our trained modular Hypercolumn-like features and ControlNet. The hypercolumn-like features are trained using a self-supervised method. Based on these features, we train several ControlNets. This approach utilizes a comprehensive modular feature set that is automatically learned and differentiated, resulting in robustness and generalization transfer capabilities. By configuring and combining appropriate control modules, it can effectively transfer to features without prior learning. We exclusively train them on the COCO dataset, yet they demonstrate the ability to generalize across various image styles, including those generated from ancient rock paintings, Chinese monochromes, oil paintings, scribbles, and more. Notably, it maintains strong performance even when dealing with lower-quality ancient rock paintings and oil paintings. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Cause our work is based on ControlNet, please refer to [ControlNet Docs](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet?tab=readme-ov-file#production-ready-pretrained-models) to install environment.


## üöÄ Quickstart

```python
python tutorial_train.py
```

## üîß Setting

You can modify model and dataset in `tutorial_train.py`:
```python
modelarch_path = './models/cldm_v15.yaml'
resume_path = './image_log/checkpoint_deconv_down2_3/last.ckpt'
logger_path = 'shuimo_deconv2_3_test'
dataset_name = 'MyDatasetShuimo'
```

To select different hypercolumn, refer to `./models/cldm_v15.yaml`:
```yaml
hyperconfig:
  target: cldm.cldm.HyperColumnLGN
  params: 
    hypercond: [0]
    size: 512
```
